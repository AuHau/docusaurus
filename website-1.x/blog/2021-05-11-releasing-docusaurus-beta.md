After a lengthy alpha stage in order to ensure feature parity and quality, we are excited to officially release the first **Docusaurus 2 beta**.

With the announcement of this beta, the team is even more confident that Docusaurus 2 is **ready for mainstream adoption**!

## Docusaurus adoption

**Don't fear the beta tag!**

Docusaurus 2 is widely adopted and growing fast:

Our new [showcase](https://docusaurus.io/showcase) page allows you to **filter Docusaurus sites by features**: get inspired by real-world production sites with a similar use-case!

Don't miss our [favorite](https://docusaurus.io/showcase?tags=favorite) sites, they all stand out with something unique:

## Why was Docusaurus v2 in alpha for so long?

It's hard to believe that the first alpha release [v2.0.0-alpha.0](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/releases/tag/v2.0.0-alpha.0) was 2 years ago ðŸ˜³ , unusually long for a software alpha.

It was definitively a very long and unusual alpha period.

Docusaurus 2 has reached **feature parity** with Docusaurus 1 with **[i18n](https://docusaurus.io/blog/2021/03/09/releasing-docusaurus-i18n)**, and it has been **successfully adopted** by many Docusaurus sites (see [i18n showcase](https://docusaurus.io/showcase?tags=i18n)).

We're now confident that the **core features** of Docusaurus 2 are **stable enough** to be in beta.

## What are the goals of the beta?

We will use the beta phase to **improve our theming system**.

We want to make it:

- **easier to implement a custom theme**, including for ourselves. We want to provide [multiple official themes](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/3522) (including [Tailwind CSS](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/2961)) for a long time.

- **safer to extend an existing theme**: it can be painful to upgrade a **highly customized** Docusaurus site, as customizations can **conflict with internal changes**. We need to make the theme public API surface more explicit, and make it clear what is safe to customize.

We will build a better **theming infrastructure** and refactor the classic theme to use it.

If you don't customize your Docusaurus site much, you can consider Docusaurus stable.

## What's new?

In case you missed it, we recently shipped two major improvements:

- [Auto-generated sidebars](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar#sidebar-item-autogenerated): no need to maintain a `sidebars.js` file anymore!
- [Webpack 5 / PostCSS 8](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/4027): persistent caching significantly speeds up **rebuild time**!

## What's next?

We will continue to **fix bugs** and implement the **most wanted features**, some of them are:

- [Sidebar category index pages](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/2643)
- [Proper CSS-in-JS support](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/3236)
- [Extend Docusaurus plugins, CMS integration](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/4138)
- [Fix trailing slashes and relative link issues](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/3372)
- [Better compatibility with CommonMark](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/3018)
- [Upgrade to MDX 2.0](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/4029)

## Conclusion

This is an exciting time for Docusaurus.

We read a lot of **positive feedbacks** about Docusaurus, and discover **new sites online** every single day.

We hope that removing the **alpha label** will be reassuring for the community, and **increase adoption** even more.

**Docusaurus 1 will be deprecated** at the end of the beta phase: it is a good time to schedule an **upgrade to Docusaurus 2**!

Thanks for reading.
